##  Business Problem

The Sales & Product Analytics team wants to understand **overall sales performance**, **customer behavior**, and **product-level trends** based on historical transaction data.  
The insights from this analysis will support:

- Forecasting demand  
- Optimizing inventory  
- Improving customer segmentation  
- Identifying best-selling and underperforming products  
- Understanding seasonality in sales  

This type of analysis is central to both **E-commerce/Retail** and **SaaS/Product Analytics**, making it a strong foundation for portfolio projects.
